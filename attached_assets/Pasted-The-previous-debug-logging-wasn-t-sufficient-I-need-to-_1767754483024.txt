The previous debug logging wasn't sufficient. I need to see exactly what's happening for EVERY trade that gets processed, not just when configs are found.
Please add this comprehensive debug logging to handle_websocket_trade() in bot.py:
After the line that filters out SELL orders (if side == 'SELL': return), add detailed logging that shows for each trade:
python# Add this right after the SELL filter
print(f"[WS DEBUG] Processing BUY trade: ${value:,.0f}, wallet={wallet[:10]}..., is_fresh={is_fresh}, is_sports={is_sports}, is_bond={is_bond}", flush=True)
Then, for each config in the loop, log the threshold comparison:
pythonfor config in configs:
    print(f"[WS DEBUG] Checking against guild {config.guild_id}: whale_threshold=${config.whale_threshold:,.0f}, value=${value:,.0f}", flush=True)
    
    # Show why a trade does or doesn't qualify
    if value >= config.whale_threshold:
        print(f"[WS DEBUG] ✓ Trade qualifies for whale alert!", flush=True)
    else:
        print(f"[WS DEBUG] ✗ Trade below whale threshold (${value:,.0f} < ${config.whale_threshold:,.0f})", flush=True)
Also, please check what the current whale_threshold is set to in the database. Add a log line at bot startup (in on_ready) that queries and prints all ServerConfig records with their thresholds:
python# Add to on_ready after "Slash commands synced"
session = get_session()
try:
    all_configs = session.query(ServerConfig).all()
    print(f"[STARTUP] Found {len(all_configs)} server configs:", flush=True)
    for c in all_configs:
        print(f"[STARTUP] Guild {c.guild_id}: whale=${c.whale_threshold}, fresh=${c.fresh_wallet_threshold}, sports=${c.sports_threshold}, paused={c.is_paused}", flush=True)
finally:
    session.close()
```

This will help me see:
1. What thresholds are actually configured
2. Why each trade is or isn't triggering an alert

After Replit makes these changes, you should see logs like:
```
[WS DEBUG] Processing BUY trade: $124, wallet=0x1234abcd..., is_fresh=False, is_sports=False, is_bond=False
[WS DEBUG] Checking against guild 1029388897647607889: whale_threshold=$10,000, value=$124
[WS DEBUG] ✗ Trade below whale threshold ($124 < $10,000)
